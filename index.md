## <span style="color: red">I am looking for a job! [My Resume.](/resume/)</span>

I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student at [the Department of Computing](https://www.comp.polyu.edu.hk), [the Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk), supervised by [Dr. Wu Xiao-Ming](http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csxmwu/), and expected to graduate in 2022.
 I obtained my B.E. degree from [the College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/english/), [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).
My main area of interest is machine learning, both theoretical and practical.


## Current Interests and Projects:
- Machine Learning
    - Semi-supervised Learning
    - Unsupervised Learning
    - Learning from Graph-Structured Data
- Graph Signal Processing
    - Graph Convolution
    - Graph Sampling
